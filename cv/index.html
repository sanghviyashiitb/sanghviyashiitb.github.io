<h2 class="cv_header"> Selected Research Experience</h2>
<ul>
	<li> <b> Imaging Strong Scatterers in Inverse Scattering </b> | Project Scientist <i class="float_right"> Sep.'18 – Present</i><br> 
		<i>Guide: Prof. Uday Khankhoje</i> <br>
		- Developing a deep learning based framework to solve the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem, building up on the existing iterative solutions and aimed at addressing the issue of imaging strong scatterers. The existing solutions converge to false minima for strong scatterers due to the global non-linear effects which become more pronounced as strength of scatterers increase. 
		<br>
		<br>
	<li> <b>Wavelets in Inverse Scattering</b> | Master's Thesis <i class="float_right"> May'17 – May'18 </i><br>
		<i>Guide: Prof. Vikram Gadre</i> <br>
		- Formulated iteratively reweighted variation of the joint L<sub>1</sub>-L<sub>2</sub> regularization Born iterative method to obtain improved dielectric profile reconstructions. <br>
		- Explored wavelet-sparsity based methods to solve the inverse scattering problem under the assumption of Born approximation. <br>
		- Developed a non-linear constrained optimization framework to solve inverse scattering problem. The local minima encountered are circumvented by a penalty function based approach to imposing physical constraints. <br>
		- Manuscript titled '<b>Inverse Scattering via Constrained Optimization</b>' submitted to <i>IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging</i> and currently under review.<br>
		<br>
	<li> <b>Texas Instruments, Bangalore</b> | Summer Intern <i class="float_right">May’16 – Jul.’16</i><br>
		<i>Time-of-Flight Camera Team</i>  <br>
		- Developed novel metrology system to extract dimensions of objects from ToF images using classical computer vision based methods. The metrology system was integrated into <i>Voxel Viewer</i>, the in-house software for depth image visualization and camera-to-PC interface.<br>
		- Formulated a novel calibration procedure for low resolution depth camera (60×80 and 240×320) which simultaneously estimated the camera parameters (optical center and focal length) and per-pixel phase offset.
