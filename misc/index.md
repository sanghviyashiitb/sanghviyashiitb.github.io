### 2019
* **30 Oct**: It was my turn to present a paper at ML reading group this week and the paper I chose  was ['Seeing Into Darkness: Scotopic Visual Recogntition'](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Chen_Seeing_Into_Darkness_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf). Lots of stuff to cover in 20 minutes but here are the [slides](/SeeingIntoDarkness_MLReadingGroup.pdf) - hopefully doing justice to the paper.
