## Hi there, I'm Yash Sanghvi!
### Personal Webpage - Less than Frequently Updated
I'm currently a camera systems engineer at Qualcomm, San Diego. You can find the latest version of my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15qwFCV2kif__zmMnGueJy5TvmRdqseVs/view?usp=sharing).

### Bio
I graduated with a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University in May 2024. During my PhD, I had the fortune of working under [Prof. Stanley Chan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html), focussing on inverse problems such as photon limited deblurring and blind deconvolution. Before joining Purdue, I was a project scientist at IIT Madras  - working under the guidance of [Prof. Uday K.](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/) on the inverse scattering problem. My research interests include **computational imaging**, **inverse problems** and intersection of these fields with **deep learning**.

I grew up in the wonderful city of Indore which is famous for its street food and being the cleanest place in the country. I have a [younger sister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swadha-sanghvi/) - also an EE graduate from IIT Bombay.
