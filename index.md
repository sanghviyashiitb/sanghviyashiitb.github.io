### Hi there, I'm Yash Sanghvi!
I'm currently a graduate research assistant at the [SSIP Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/) in Department of ECE, Purdue Univeristy. Before this, I was employed as a project scientist for an year at IIT Madras under the guidance of [Prof. Uday K.](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/).  I worked on the inverse scattering problem, and hey, I also got [published in the process!](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8709721)

##### Bio
I graduated from IIT Bombay with a dual degree in Electrical Engineering (B. Tech + M. Tech.) in 2018. My research interests include **computational imaging**, **inverse problems**, **signal processing** and intersection of these fields with **compressed sensing** and **machine learning**.
You can find .pdf version of my CV [here](/Sanghvi_CV.pdf).
