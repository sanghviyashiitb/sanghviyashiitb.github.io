## Hi there, I'm Yash Sanghvi!
### Personal Webpage - Less than Frequently Updated
I'm currently a graduate research assistant at the I2-Lab in Department of ECE, Purdue Univeristy, working under [Prof. Stanley Chan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html).  You can find my CV [here](/CV_YashSanghvi.pdf)

### Bio
I graduated from IIT Bombay with a dual degree in Electrical Engineering (B. Tech + M. Tech.) in 2018. Before joining Purdue, I was a project scientist at IIT Madras  - working under the guidance of [Prof. Uday K.](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/) on the inverse scattering problem. My research interests include **computational imaging**, **inverse problems**, **signal processing** and intersection of these fields with **compressed sensing** and **machine learning**.
I grew up in the wonderful city of Indore which is famous for its street food and being the cleanest place in the country. I have a younger sister - also an EE graduate from IIT Bombay.
