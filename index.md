## Hi there, I'm Yash Sanghvi!
### Personal Webpage - Less than Frequently Updated
I'm currently a graduate research assistant at the [SSIP Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/) in Department of ECE, Purdue Univeristy, working under [Prof. Stanley Chan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html). Before joining Purdue, I was employed as a project scientist for an year at IIT Madras under the guidance of [Prof. Uday K.](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/), continuing work on the [inverse scattering problem](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8709721).

### Bio
I graduated from IIT Bombay with a dual degree in Electrical Engineering (B. Tech + M. Tech.) in 2018. My research interests include **computational imaging**, **inverse problems**, **signal processing** and intersection of these fields with **compressed sensing** and **machine learning**.
You can find .pdf version of my CV [here](/Sanghvi_CV.pdf).

I grew up in the wonderful city of Indore, located in the middle of India, which is famous for its [street food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDr2k9NbrHE) and being the cleanest place in the country. I have a younger sister - also pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering from my IIT Bombay.
